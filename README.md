# ChainiForge | Industry-Standard Polygon CDK One-Click Deployer 🚀

ChainiForge is an enterprise-grade "One-Click" deployment platform for the Polygon ecosystem. It transforms the complex task of launching a Layer 2 network into a high-end SaaS experience, fully compatible with the 2026 AggLayer roadmap.

## 🏗️ 2026 Roadmap Compliance

### 1. Modular Data Availability (DA)
Don't settle for static storage. ChainiForge allows enterprises to choose their DA tier based on cost and security needs:
- **Ethereum L1**: Maximum security for high-value financial networks.
- **Avail / Celestia**: Modular DA for cost-optimized, high-volume social or gaming chains.
- **Data Availability Committee (DAC)**: Private, permissioned consortia for enterprise groups.

### 2. AggLayer & Pessimistic Proofs
Switch from isolated sidechains to **Unified Liquidity**. ChainiForge integrates **Pessimistic Proofs** by default when connecting to the AggLayer, ensuring cross-chain security and preventing double-spending without sacrificing sovereignty.

### 3. Enterprise Operations & Observability
- **ZKP Prover Performance**: Real-time monitoring of proof generation time and cost-per-proof.
- **Guardian Dashboard (Emergency Brake)**: A "Guardian Mode" to pause bridges or the sequencer during vulnerability windows—standard for early-stage enterprise L2s.
- **Economic Estimator**: A built-in calculator to estimate gas savings when migrating from Ethereum L1 to a CDK Validium.

### 4. Developer Sandbox
ChainiForge doesn't just deploy the chain; it builds the ecosystem.
- **SDK Generation**: One-click boilerplate for Hardhat, Foundry, and React (Wagmi).
- **Hybrid-Live Experience**: Every deployment triggers a Management Contract on **Polygon Amoy (Testnet)** via `viem`, making the "SaaS experience" tangible and on-chain.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism Design System)
- **On-Chain**: `viem` for testnet interactions and receipt tracking.
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform templates for AWS EC2/EKS orchestration.
- **Icons & Motion**: Lucide React + Framer Motion.

## 🏃 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ChainiForge.git
cd ChainiForge
npm install
npm run dev
```
