# Implementation Plan - Polygon CDK One-Click Deployer (ChainiForge)

## 🌐 Live Demo
**ChainiForge is now live:** https://chainiforge.vercel.app

## Overview
ChainiForge is a "One-Click" deployment platform for Polygon CDK Layer 2 networks. It simplifies the complex process of infrastructure setup, compliance integration, and economic configuration into a streamlined web interface.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + Vanilla CSS (Premium design with glassmorphism)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (for smooth transitions)
- **Backend Simulation**: Node.js (to simulate infrastructure orchestration)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (for Paymaster and Verified Bridge templates)

## Phase 1: Foundation & Design System
- [ ] Initialize Vite project
- [ ] Set up a robust Vanilla CSS design system (colors, typography, glassmorphism utilities)
- [ ] Create core layout component (Sidebar, Header, Main Content)

## Phase 2: Advanced Configuration Wizard
- [ ] **Infrastructure Pillar**: Rollup vs Validium + **Modular DA Selection** (Ethereum, Avail, Celestia, DAC)
- [ ] **Economy Pillar**: Native Gas Token + **Gas Savings Estimator**
- [ ] **Permissions Pillar**: Public vs Whitelist + **Polygon ID Verification Schemes**
- [ ] **Connectivity Pillar**: AggLayer + **Pessimistic Proof Integration**

## Phase 3: Enterprise Modules & Observability
- [ ] **Compliance Engine**: Advanced KYC/AML schemes
- [ ] **Guardian Dashboard**: Emergency Brake (Pause Bridge/Sequencer)
- [ ] **Advanced Metrics**: ZKP Prover Performance (Proof Time, Cost per Proof)

## Phase 4: Developer & Hybrid-Live Experience
- [ ] **Developer Sandbox**: Boilerplate generator (Hardhat/Foundry)
- [ ] **Hybrid-Live Deployment**: Actual contract deployment on Polygon Amoy using `viem`
- [ ] **Mock Orchestration**: Enhanced terminal logs reflecting DA and AggLayer setup

## Phase 5: Final Polish ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add micro-animations and hover effects
- [x] Ensure responsive design
- [x] SEO optimization and meta tags
